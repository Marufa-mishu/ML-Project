My project investigated the use of machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression and feedforward neural networks (FNNs), for non-invasive estimation of blood pressure (BP) values from photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Leveraging a dataset containing PPG, ECG, and corresponding BP measurements, I preprocessed the signals, extracted relevant features, and developed predictive models. Evaluation using root mean squared error (RMSE) and cross-validation revealed the superiority of the FNN model over linear regression in capturing the complex, non-linear relationships between the input physiological signals and the target BP values. While the FNN model demonstrated promising results, achieving a lower RMSE of 26.28 compared to 27.34 for linear regression, further validation on diverse datasets and clinical studies are necessary before practical deployment in healthcare applications. My project contributes to the growing research in non-invasive vital parameter estimation and highlights the potential of machine learning, particularly neural networks, in this domain.
